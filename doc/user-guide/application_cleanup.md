# Application Cleanup

Community users are subjected to cleanup of their applications until they upgrade to pro users.

User cleanup occurs every 12 hours by verifying traffic to the application.

User Apps are put into a stopped state for upto 36 hours prior to being cleaned up. The users during this time frame can restart the application.
